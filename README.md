# IMDb reviews Sentiment Analysis
In this project we will perform a sentiment analysis and other visual analysis on the reviews of 21 Disney movies from the 1950's to the 2010's (3 movies for each decade) taken from the IMDb website.
<br> At the end we will be able to tell which decade has the highest reviewed movies based on our sample.
<br>The project is divided in four sections:
<br> **1. Web Scraping
<br> 2. Database creation
<br> 3. Analysis**
